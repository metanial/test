# 🏥 Medical Cost Prediction Project

This project aims to predict medical costs using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on multiple linear regression. By analyzing various personal characteristics, we can estimate individual medical expenses, which can be valuable for insurance companies, healthcare providers, and patients in financial planning.

## Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>

Medical costs can vary significantly among individuals based on various factors such as age, medical conditions, lifestyle choices, and geographic location. This project uses machine learning to understand these relationships and make accurate cost predictions. We'll analyze the Medical Cost Personal Dataset from Kaggle to identify patterns and build a predictive model.

## Dataset Description <a name="dataset-description"></a>

The dataset includes several important features that influence medical costs:
- 👴 Age: The patient's age
- 🚻 Sex: The patient's gender
- 🏋️ BMI: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight
- 👶 Children: Number of dependents covered by health insurance
- 🚭 Smoker: Whether the patient is a smoker
- 📍 Region: The beneficiary's residential area in the US
- 💰 Charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance (our target variable)

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)

### Installation <a name="installation"></a>

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AISOC-KIIT/Projects.git
cd Medical_Cost_Prediction
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project <a name="running-the-project"></a>

1. First Steps:
   - Download the Medical Cost Personal Dataset from Kaggle
   - Place the dataset in the `data/` folder as `raw_data.csv`

2. Data Exploration:
   - Open `notebooks/1_exploration.ipynb`
   - This notebook guides you through understanding the data and preparing it for modeling

3. Model Development:
   - Open `notebooks/2_modeling.ipynb`
   - Follow the steps to build and evaluate the prediction model

## Analysis Approach <a name="analysis-approach"></a>

Our analysis follows these main steps:

1. Data Exploration and Cleaning
   - Examine data distributions
   - Handle missing values
   - Identify outliers
   - Visualize relationships between features

2. Feature Engineering
   - Transform numerical features if needed
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Create interaction terms if beneficial

3. Model Development
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Train multiple linear regression model
   - Evaluate model performance
   - Analyze feature importance

## Results Interpretation <a name="results-interpretation"></a>

The model's predictions can help understand:
- Which factors most strongly influence medical costs
- How lifestyle choices (like smoking) affect insurance charges
- Potential cost variations across different regions
- The impact of age and BMI on medical expenses

## Limitations <a name="limitations"></a>

It's important to acknowledge that this model has limitations:
- The model is based on a specific dataset and may not generalize perfectly to other populations or time periods.
- Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable, which may not always be the case.
- The model does not account for all possible factors that could influence medical costs.
- The model's predictions are estimates and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical or financial advice.

## Future Improvements <a name="future-improvements"></a>

Consider these enhancements to the project:
- Explore advanced regression techniques (e.g., polynomial regression, regularization).
- Incorporate additional features (e.g., health conditions, family history).
- Develop a user interface for easier interaction with the model.
- Add confidence intervals to predictions.
